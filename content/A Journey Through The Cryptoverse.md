How many of you have tried to sound smart by throwing in a little “crypto”, “bitcoin” and “NFT” into conversations? *crickets* Just me then? Alright, let’s pretend like you didn’t just lie.

On that note, this blog’s all about Coinbase, the most popular consumer-facing crypto-asset exchange in the United States. Let’s dive in, it’s good to be back :)

## Wall Street Crypto-Finance-Bro Starter Pack

Don’t worry I know you folks know everything there is about crypto, so I’m writing this bit for the 2.5 people who raised their hands for my first question. Here’s everything you need to know about crypto assets and exchanges in 5 points:

1. Crypto assets are like special kinds of money that you can only use on a computer. Just like how you can use regular money to buy things you want, you can use crypto assets to buy things too, _but only on a computer._
2. Crypto assets are made using something called “blockchain technology,” which is like a big, secure computer database that keeps track of all the crypto assets and who owns them. Because this database is so secure, it’s very hard for someone to cheat or steal your crypto assets.
3. To obtain crypto assets, you need to go to a special place on the computer called a “_crypto exchange_.” It’s like a store where you can buy different types of crypto assets using regular money, just like how you can buy toys or candy at a store using regular money.
4. First, you need to create an account on the crypto exchange website by providing some personal information and creating a password. Then, you can add regular money to your account using a credit card or a bank transfer. Once you have money in your account, you can use it to buy different types of crypto assets, like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
5. Some people like using crypto assets because they think it’s really cool to use special computer money, while others think it’s a good investment and the price might go up in the future. But just like with regular money, it’s important to be careful and not spend more than you can afford to lose.

Wow that was a lot of crypto assets, ANYWAY —

## Humble Beginnings

Once upon a time (well, in July 2011 to be precise), Brian Armstrong founded Coinbase — Fast forward a year to 2012, and another finance whiz, Fred Ehrsam, jumped on board. And just like that, Coinbase started capturing the hearts (and wallets) of crypto enthusiasts around the globe. Today, Coinbase is a global powerhouse with 3 primary lines of business:

- For individuals: Coinbase, Wallet, USD Coin
- For businesses: Prime, Commerce, Exchange
- For developers: Cloud, Connect, WalletLink

In 2015, Coinbase became the first Bitcoin exchange to receive a license from a US regulatory authority. Now let’s take a look at some interesting moves they made to stand out.

## Less Talk, More Bitcoin

The full [60-second ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIUD_NE1BDo&t=1s) almost entirely consisted of a colorful bouncing QR code, reminiscent of the iconic [bouncing DVD logo meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bouncing-dvd-logo). When scanned, the code brought viewers to Coinbase’s promotional website, offering a limited-time promotion of $15 worth of free Bitcoin to new sign-ups, along with a $3 million giveaway that customers can enter.

The ad turned out to be so popular that the app crashed for about an hour. To be more precise, Coinbase had more than 20M hits on its landing page in one minute and the engagement was 6 times higher than previous benchmarks. It was hence historic and unprecedented.

_The Crash Landing Page (haha)_

As an effect, the Coinbase app also skyrocketed in popularity, rising from 186th place to 2nd on Apple’s App Store.

## Going once, going twice, sold

Sotheby’s is one of the world’s oldest and most prestigious auction houses, specializing in the sale of fine art, jewelry, antiques, and other high-value assets. Teaming up with Sotheby’s to facilitate the sale of Banksy’s iconic artwork using cryptocurrency was a super smart move by Coinbase. By enabling buyers to purchase such a valuable and historically significant piece of art with Bitcoin and Ether, Coinbase showed that cryptocurrency is not just for tech geeks or early adopters anymore — it’s a legitimate payment option for anyone.

_Banksy, Love is in the air_

The price for Banksy’s ‘Love is in the Air’ painting sold through Sotheby’s in collaboration with Coinbase was not publicly disclosed. However, the estimated value of the painting was between $3 million and $5 million USD. The painting was sold to an anonymous bidder, who paid for the artwork using Bitcoin or Ether through Coinbase. This sale marked a significant moment for both the art world and the cryptocurrency industry, demonstrating the growing acceptance of digital currencies as a legitimate form of payment for high-value assets.

## Long Live Crypto

[Long Live Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCEvIiY0mR4&t=1s) was Coinbase’s 10th birthday present to crypto bashers. The ad showed tweets dating back to 2012, with the authors’ names blurred out, declaring “Crypto is dead.”

https://twitter.com/i/status/1527121134562385920

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If we had a bitcoin for every time somebody said “crypto is dead” … <a href="https://t.co/nlYWQXUFWO">pic.twitter.com/nlYWQXUFWO</a></p>&mdash; Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1527121134562385920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2022</a></blockquote>



Okay but why is this significant?  
1. Coinbase was going through some sort of a rough patch back then. The crypto market had shed roughly $1 trillion in value just a month before it turned 10, while Coinbase shares had tanked more than 50%. At a time when crypto was reeling from a severe downturn and Coinbase was making spending cutbacks, the reactions were understandably mixed.

2. The Ad was aired during the NBA Western Conference finals game between the Golden State Warriors and the Dallas Mavericks. The choice of the Warriors game was symbolic. Former Warriors player Kevin Durant invested in Coinbase, and Coinbase and the NBA [struck the league’s first cryptocurrency sponsorship deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/19/nba-lands-first-cryptocurrency-sponsorship-with-coinbase.html) during the “better days” of crypto.

To conclude, “Long Live Crypto” was a smart move by Coinbase, because even though the company hit a low at the time, by reinforcing the company’s commitment to cryptocurrencies and providing a positive (in its own way) message, Coinbase was able to maintain its position as a leading player in the cryptocurrency industry.

## What Crpto? Nah, Why Crypto.

Coinbase threw a few punches at the American Financial System with this one and well, where was the lie? “[It’s Time to Update the System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEi7rub0jcs)” is a simple and straightforward campaign that basically says why use age-old financial systems when we actively know that crypto could make it way more efficient.

<iframe width="545" height="307" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEi7rub0jcs" title="It’s Time to Update the System" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There’s no witty messaging or subtle shade-throwing here, and yet it makes you question some processes that you’re so used to already that you don’t question them. Here’s the campaign summed up in three points:  
1. Why are you waiting in ATM lines when crypto is 24/7 and instant?  
2. Why are you bearing extra charges and waiting days for your international transfers to go through?  
3. Why trust banks when you can make transparent, immutable, and verifiable transactions?

These are pretty obvious issues we’ve had all along if you think about it and personally, my answer to all those questions is — well, I just do. Why? Because I’ve been doing it all my life. It probably is time to update the system.

## To conclude,

Coinbase’s growth has always been dependent on three pillars:  
1. **Crypto as an investment — A**dding new cryptocurrencies to its platform and investing in crypto remains Coinbase’s core business.  
2. **Crypto as a new financial system —** Building new products that help crypto holders use their coins and access decentralized finance tools.  
3. **Crypto as an app platform —** Helping its users to discover new crypto apps and will provide funding for projects through Coinbase Ventures.

I could go on and on here but I’m going to keep my under 5-minute read promise. So TL;DR — crypto very good, Coinbase smart. 👍
