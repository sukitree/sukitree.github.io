## I’m Not Like Other Exchanges
Why are you taking 5 minutes of your life to read about yet another crypto company? Well, Okcoin sets itself apart by setting the bar high. Here’s a quick rundown of why they stand out —

Okcoin started in 2013, and since then it has been serving people and businesses across 190+ countries — more than any other US-based exchange. Okcoin is also a top-regulated cryptocurrency exchange, which means it follows the highest standards of security, compliance, and customer protection. This gives Okcoin an advantage over other platforms that may have trouble with the regulators or the law — which is very common in the cryptocurrency industry. Now that you have a fair idea of what Okcoin does, let’s talk about what they did right.

## The First Penguin

Okcoin has always been ahead of the game by listing the newest cryptocurrencies on its platform. They don’t seem to be afraid to take risks and explore new opportunities in the crypto space, and that’s what makes them stand out from the crowd. Let me show you how:

- In April 2018, Okcoin became the first exchange to list **EOS**, a blockchain platform that supports decentralized applications (dApps). EOS was launched in June 2018 and has since become one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
- In January 2021, Okcoin was the first regulated exchange to list **Stacks** (STX), a layer-1 blockchain that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin. Stacks allow users to earn Bitcoin rewards by participating in the network.
- In April 2022, Okcoin became the first exchange in the U.S. to list **HASH**, a utility token that powers the Provenance blockchain. Provenance is a platform that enables financial institutions to track and verify assets and transactions on a distributed ledger.

By doing so over the years, Okcoin has given its customers access to some of the most cutting-edge and exciting crypto projects in the market. Pretty neat.

## Knocking On DeFi’s Door

While we’re talking about “firsts”, Okcoin was also the first to offer an API to access DeFi, enabling institutions to seamlessly incorporate DeFi earning opportunities into their products and investment workflows. Don’t worry I won’t go all finance-bro on you. So what is DeFi?

DeFi, or decentralized finance, is a fast-growing sector of the cryptocurrency industry that offers various financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and investing without intermediaries.

By providing an API to access DeFi, Okcoin allows institutions to tap into the high returns and innovation that DeFi offers, while also enjoying the security and compliance that Okcoin provides as a regulated exchange. This way, institutions can diversify their portfolios, enhance their customer experience, and gain a competitive edge in the crypto space.

## The Glow Up

Rebranding is a risky task for any brand to execute successfully (*cough* Twitter *cough*), but it was probably one of the best decisions Okcoin made.

In April 2021, they launched a new website, logo, and vision, which resulted in a significant increase in customer growth. Okcoin’s rebranding aimed to reflect its mission of making crypto _accessible and inclusive_ for everyone, as well as its values of simplicity, transparency, and trust. The story behind certain elements of their rebranding is pretty cool and very well thought out. Here’s a [blog](https://blog.okcoin.com/discovering-our-brand/) from their CMO about the same.

Okcoin saw a jump in new customers in the very first month, as well as an increase in retention and engagement rates. The rebranding also helped Okcoin differentiate itself from other exchanges and establish a strong brand identity in the crypto space. A rebranding as strong as this one was a great growth move for the company, and Mia Thermopolis from the Princess Diaries :)

## Okcoin At Your Fingertips

Hold up, we’re almost done. Okcoin launched its mobile app in 2021 and can we take a second to appreciate the look and flow of the app. This app allows users to buy, sell, trade, and earn crypto with ease and convenience, let me list out a few features for you:

- It enables users to access their portfolios, check their earnings, and see a breakdown of the assets they own in one place.
- It offers various earning opportunities through Okcoin Earn, which makes it easy for anyone to be part of DeFi, or decentralized finance.
- It allows users to automate their portfolio by setting recurring buys and controlling their average price, without any fees.
- It is secure and compliant, as Okcoin is a regulated exchange that keeps deposits safe through offline storage, 24/7 transaction monitoring, and multi-factor encryption. It also has no transaction downtime, ensuring reliable service.
- It is user-friendly and educational, as it makes it easy to learn about and buy crypto assets. It also provides resources and guides to help users broaden their knowledge about crypto. Probably my favorite part of the entire app — as minor as it may be, I think anything related to your finances can be overwhelming so breaking it down in this manner is a great way to be more inclusive to people who have little knowledge in this field.

**To conclude,  
**I think my favorite aspect of what this company does is that- **whether you are a beginner or a pro**, you can find a suitable platform to buy, sell, and trade crypto assets with low fees, high security, and fast transactions.

When you’re building anything remotely related to finance, and the complex seems comprehensible for newcomers while you offer advanced features for seasoned traders — you’ve really won.

With the app being their best point of contact with their customers, I’m excited to see new features and potential improvements that would further elevate the user experience and solidify Okcoin’s position in the industry.

Okay I think that’s enough praise, I’ll go pick on what’s wrong with this app now.  _(update as of June 8, 2024 - I now do this for a living)_
