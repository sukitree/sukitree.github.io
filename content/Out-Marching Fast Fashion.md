We live in times where Pinterest and Instagram dictate the new trendy fits for the month and you rush to the best fast fashion brand out there to get your hands on some of the items. I’ve done it too and trust me, that satisfaction is so short-lived. Imagine taking your time, purchasing good quality basics that you can shuffle around to build different outfits.

Imagine having a T-shirt that you could wear to work, for drinks, or even to a baby shower. Something that you could pair with your favorite pair of denims, skirt, or blazer. It sounds like a very first-world problem, maybe it is. But someone sure did solve it, in their own casual chic way.

Want basic tees but have no idea where to find them?

_*Enter March Tees*_

No branding, no life-altering quotes, just plain, good-quality T-shirts.

# Ma, I have nothing to wear.

Around 7 years ago, the goal was pretty simple. The founders wanted well-crafted high-quality tees. The problem was, that these folks didn’t have a clue about how the apparel industry works. But they put in the work, understood how the apparel industry’s supply chain and manufacturing functioned, and did everything in their power to make sure they figured out the ins and outs of this business. And in June 2016, they launched their own T-shirt brand, with just one style and three colors.

# You March, I March, everybody March

March has built a solid customer base through Instagram and Word-Of-Mouth but what I absolutely adore is their blogs. No influencers or Bollywood personalities, just real, diverse, grounded people. From business owners to ex-army officers, they’ve documented real user stories. They don’t talk to their subjects to get a testimonial out of them. Instead, you see the subject talking about their life, the ups and downs, and everything in between. It’s truly wholesome.

# Storytelling at its best

You’ve seen how these folks build wholesome content around their users' lives, but they’re even better at leveraging storytelling to build a solid connection with their customers. March pretty much nailed the understanding of their own audience and it was clear they’re truly interested in what goes on behind the scenes.

The team at March has a very nerdy, ‘what-goes-into-this’ approach to apparel, and their audience loves it. From the whole process of making the tee to bringing up stories of users wearing it, the entire user journey is documented so beautifully. The most viewed video on their Instagram feed is not a celebrity promotion, but [a close look at how they guard their Supima fiber against contamination.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5GMOFppqk4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

**Science Time**: _Supima fiber is the source of the comfort and softness of the March Tee. Supima is licensed and trademarked extra-long fiber cotton that grows in the USA (only in California, Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico). The fibers have an average length of 1.5 inches, whereas usually cotton fibers typically have a length of about 1 inch. Long fibers give the fabric strength, softness as well as the ability to resist lint formation over time._

The quality of the fiber doesn’t just contribute to wearability but it also doesn’t feel very thin or flimsy, thereby permitting you to wear it in a smart setting where you’d want your t-shirt to look the part, without it coming across as carelessly casual.

# All the nice things in life are limited apparently

March’s range of products is not very vast and because of production constraints, release lots are small and are sold out quickly. I personally think limiting the quantity really brings out how much they focus on quality and in turn, it’s all the more appealing.

A while ago, March launched a separate Home range with towels, shorts, and pajamas and you guessed it, they sold out pretty quickly. It’s products like these that make you refresh the website 10 times just to make sure you get your pick before it sells out. The value that brands like March have created can never be achieved by brands selling low-quality fast fashion.

# Minimal, clean, and transparent

March’s clean, minimal aesthetic follows through the entire pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase experience. From the no clutter, minimal website to the realistic photography and the best multi-layered packaging. Thoughtful touches like warm handwritten messages (“Your first March Tee!”) and [detailed care instructions](https://www.marchtee.com/care) add to the well-crafted brand personality.

As a brand, they’re also quite transparent to their customers. From their communication to their blog posts where they’ve gone on to talk about visitor and sales statistics, rejection rates, and things like that. This stuff keeps trust and engagement levels high and kudos to March for that.

## To conclude,

It’s amazing to see a homegrown brand solving a very interesting but common problem of finding the right tee.

The hardest thing in life is to keep things simple… is something I’m pretty sure is printed on a T-shirt by some guy trying to channel his mid-life crisis and overall emptiness. But it makes so much sense in this scenario, because how many of us have really found that perfect plain tee?

See now I’ve given you a mid-life wardrobe crisis.

Maybe you should print it on a T-shirt.
