Being an engineering student, I completely understand the value that coding brings to the table in today's world. It’s clearly valued in the workforce and it teaches you some core skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. _However_, I’d like to see my future six-year-old kid having fun and blowing bubbles in the garden instead of being glued to the screen trying to figure out how bubble sort works. So I think the biggest question that I have for WhiteHat Jr is - _is this really necessary?_

To give y’all some context, WhiteHat Jr helps kids from age 6–18 years to build commercial-ready games, animations, and apps online using the fundamentals of coding. The breaking point of WhiteHat Jr was when their infamous ad campaigns came out. So why did WhiteHat Jr get so much hate? Let’s break it down.

## Apparently, all work and no play gets Chintu a job at Google.

The ad that I mentioned earlier was about the company’s student, Chintu, as young as six years old being chased by global investors to fund an app he built with the skills he had acquired through WhiteHat Jr classes. WhiteHat Jr had to take down this ad because of all the backlash they received, but I’m sure the trolls on YouTube have some old content you can look at. [See for yourself.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=whitehat+jr+chintu+ad)

WhiteHat Jr’s initial marketing placed an absurd amount of emphasis on employability for very young kids. They talked about how kids who take their classes are equipped with skills to get into big tech companies. The stress of getting placed is hard enough when you’re in your 20s, do we really need a generation having corporate dreams at 6 years of age?

The internet is flooded with memes on WhiteHat Jr’s ad campaign. And they’re pretty funny :)

## Playing around with education in India is no joke.

It goes without saying that education is and always has been a serious business in India. We live in a country where children talk about getting into IIT from class 9, or even earlier for that matter. The pressure every student faces in that time period between classes 9 and 12, irrespective of the career they want to pursue is just not necessary. It’s bad enough that we get compared to a “sharma ji ka beta” at that age, do we really need the parents of 6-year-olds comparing their kids to other WhiteHat Jr Chintu variants? No thank you.

The memes get better and better.

## Throwing CEOs into the mix.

This move has to be my favorite. IIT coaching centers weren’t the only ones who made use of CEOs like Sundar Pichai to advertise. You see, they used a more “come to our coaching center and we’ll get you into the institution which Sundar Pichai studied in” approach. Whereas Whitehat Jr straight up puts off a message that Bill Gates is where he is now because he built an app before he learned how to walk, urging the next generation kids to pursue coding at a young age. It’s hilarious, take a look.

## I know I’ve been critical up until now but hear me out.

If a kid wants to learn how to code at 6 years old, great. It’s amazing to see kids go after their interests and learn something new. The reason WhiteHat Jr continues to get so much backlash is because of how well it _glorifies_ coding. I understand that it’s a selling point for the company but I think they need to look out for the impact it’s having on the coming generation.

Kids who just want to play all day shouldn’t feel like they’re missing out on something or they’re falling behind in the rat race. They shouldn't feel the need to get a job at Google when they turn 10. Coding gives you money, and hence children should learn to code is not setting the right precedent if we want it to be an important part of the curriculum. This need to equate everything to potential money-spinners needs to go away.

## To conclude,

A good business always needs great marketing to thrive. I think WhiteHat Jr is a great platform for kids who are genuinely interested in coding, but I also think they need to market the product very differently to gain their brand image and trust back from the audience. I guess the approach to fuel up the rat race and get kids to feel the need to code and get rich is one way to go about it, but it’s definitely not right.

Given the backlash WhiteHat Jr received, in a way, it prompts new-age brands and startups to be a bit more responsible, progressive, and forward when it comes to their communication, especially when they’re dealing with sensitive, high-impact issues.

To end this blog on a good note, I think it’s amazing how WhiteHat Jr is now branching out and taking a “You’re never too old or young to learn anything” approach while moving forward. Now that’s some good marketing. Check it out :)
