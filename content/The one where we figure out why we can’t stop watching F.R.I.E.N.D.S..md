Before I get into this, I want to let y’all know what I think of this show in general, so here goes. Does it have this amazing, out-of-the-box storyline? No. Does it have some insanely creative sets and shots? No. Do I start watching an episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. when I need an “escape”? Oh yes. And I know it’s not just me.

People don’t watch this show at the edge of their seats waiting to see what happens next. They watch it with a glass of wine and a nice plate of food to de-stress. This show really hit the target when it comes to comfort and relatability. How did they do it? Let’s dive in.

To keep it simple, F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is a show taking you through the daily lives of six characters in their 20’s. That’s literally all the show is about. You see the cast experiencing problems in their love lives, friendships, and work. Something that every young adult goes through — and that’s what makes it so addictive. _To science this up a little bit_, a psychologist revealed that the familiarity of the plot and its relatable storylines are soothing, particularly when we’re experiencing feelings of anxiety. You see yourself and your problems in those characters and that’s what keeps you hooked.

But here’s what doesn’t make too much sense, F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is a show set in the ’90s where there’s no Instagram, Tik-Tok, or anything that Gen-Z is into these days. **So why and more importantly _how_ is it still going strong on views and popularity even today?**

# Personality matters.

Can you imagine Chandler saying, “Chandler doesn’t share food”?! No, right. But pair him up with humor and sarcasm and everything seems fine.

One of the main ingredients in the success of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is the ingenious grouping of the 6 main characters. Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross have very distinct personalities. Monica’s neurosis, Rachel’s passion for fashion, Joey’s charming stupidity, Chandler’s sarcastic jokes, Ross’s bad luck-struck love life, Phoebe’s innocence (can we call it that). Almost everyone can relate to at least one quality of any character and that’s what draws them to the show. F.R.I.E.N.D.S. fans essentially grew up with these characters, often relating to them and their complicated, crazy lives.

# Life lessons.

Despite the humor and sarcasm that mark the series, each F.R.I.E.N.D.S. episode essentially ends with a life lesson. Whether it’s to count on your friends no matter what or to NEVER wear leather pants on a first date, F.R.I.E.N.D.S had it all. The show also brought up a lot of out-of-the-norm situations that weren't portrayed at all in 90’s sitcoms. From advocating female solidarity to promoting surrogacy, the show constantly proved that it had a unique voice and message to deliver. Carol and Susan’s wedding on the show was one of the first portrayals of the LGBTQ community back then.

Divorces, surrogacy, body positivity, sexuality, and independence seem so normal to talk about now, but that wasn’t the case when the show first came out. As much as F.R.I.E.N.D.S. tried to display a positive portrayal of these issues, like any other piece of content out there, they were criticized for homophobic jokes and comments throughout the series.

# The struggle is real.

Be it, Joey, Monica, or Rachel, the cast is human and flawed — in essence, relatable. Instead of a perfect, “holier than thou” cast, you’re presented with characters who are constantly striving to prove how “They were on a break”! A broke actor, a guy stuck in a boring 9–5 job, a former rich kid who’s finding her way in the city, a younger sibling constantly trying to seek approval from her parents, a guy who can’t seem to figure out love and finally a girl who used to live on the streets. I think they pretty much hit every demographic. The show sold flawed characters by appealing to emotions and creating content that connects to the struggles that 20-year-olds were going through. It wasn’t a show where life was just sunshine and rainbows. It showed the true nature of a person's life in their 20’s. I mean, I’m pretty sure most of us out here in our 20’s don’t even have a ‘pla’.

# What sells, sells.

Did you know that after the creators realized that Janice’s “Oh My God” was popular with the audience, they ensured that it was used in every episode featuring the character? Or that the iconic duo of Monica and Chandler was just a fling that was turned into a serious couple based on the audience reaction? The name of the show itself was decided after a round of A/B Testing. The creators of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. understood what appealed to their audience and used it to their advantage.

# Mystery.

Who here hasn’t wondered whether or not Rachel and Ross would finally end up together? While the creators themselves knew that the duo would end up together early on, they kept the audience agonizing over it for 10 long years. Why? _Because Mystery Sells_. Ross and Rachel’s story was hinted at in the very first episode and after a million ups and downs, we finally see them together in one of the last episodes of the entire show. That’s one long, evil cliffhanger.

Additionally. the very identity of the infamous Ugly Naked Guy wasn’t revealed for as long as 2016. The creators held back information to get people excited. Curiosity might have killed the cat, but it definitely left viewers wanting more.

# Their job’s not a joke and they’re definitely not broke.

F.R.I.E.N.D.S. ended a long long time ago, but the show still brings in a fancy amount of money each year for the creators and cast. Through the magic of syndication revenue, F.R.I.E.N.D.S. pulls in a whopping $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. Here’s the kicker though: That translates into about a $20 million annual paycheck _each_ for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each make 2% of that syndication income.

$20 million. Each year. For doing nothing.

Just let that sink in.

That’s not the only thing that might blow your mind. Do you know how much this show made for its networks, studio, producers, distributors, talent, and various adjacent industries since it launched 27 years ago? Here's a [timeline](https://www.nexttv.com/news/friends-a-timeline-of-obscene-profitability)

**To conclude**. F.R.I.E.N.D.S. didn’t create the hangout comedy, but it refined the template for what nearly all sitcoms looked like in its wake. It was relatable but aspirational, creating characters and situations that vaguely reminded viewers of their lives. I mean, tourists flock to New York to this day to share a coffee on the couch at Central Perk.

It’s a marathon, not a sprint. When you watch an episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. you get a lot out of it, but if you watch a number of episodes, you get the bigger picture. I’ve gone through the series at least five times by now and let me tell you one thing, it’s always going to be my go-to comfort food.
