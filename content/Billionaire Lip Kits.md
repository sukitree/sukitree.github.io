#### A brilliant way to monetize an insecurity.

Kylie Jenner has always been quite open about her insecurities on the size of her lips and how it lead her to get temporary lip fillers. But she wasn’t the only one dealing with this issue. Thousands of women from all age groups related to her and that laid the foundation of her fanbase.

Her fanbase was mostly born out of her interaction with people through Vine (RIP), Snapchat, Instagram, and Tumblr. In 2015, Kylie created a YouTube Channel which focused on doing Makeup tutorials on herself: a series of tutorials on how to look like Kylie Jenner _by Kylie Jenner_. Kylie showed her followers how to overcome their insecurities by using out-of-the-box makeup techniques. For example, if you look at Kylie’s old videos, you can see her overlining her lips with lipsticks and lipliners to make them look more “filled” and thick. Now that her fans were using her makeup hacks, it was a no-brainer that they would go crazy if she launched her own makeup line.

##### _* Enter Kylie Cosmetics *_

**Kylie Lip Kits** — the first product created under the Kylie Cosmetics brand. Kylie started using her own products in her tutorials, making them more personal. So naturally, her fanbase believed that they needed to get their hands on these products to really pull off the “Kylie Jenner” look.

# The Kylie Cosmetics brand nailed the game of desirability.

It’s no surprise that the Gen Z audience are total digital natives. That’s why stars like Kylie Jenner, interact with them like peers on the mediums they feel most comfortable with. On her personal account, which Kylie often uses to promote Kylie Cosmetics, she posts pictures of her daughter, her travels, and some behind-the-scenes moments of her life, making her customer more involved with her life as well as her brand.

Kylie Cosmetics represents itself as a _limited luxury brand_ to its audience. I mean think about it, the best things should never be easy to get, otherwise what’s their value?. Kylie and her marketing team are no strangers to building demand and desire for their products. They do this by constantly posting pre-sale promotions, behind-the-scenes sneak peeks, and exclusive sales with one-time-only products. Notice those key phrases? They’re literally meant to instill curiosity and create a sense of urgency.

The images you see above are of products that aren’t even out in the market yet. But she’s here in front of her customers, trying them out on herself. Her video clips garner so much hype that they regularly make the news, so when a new product release comes around, her audience is buzzed, excited, and ready to buy. And on the day of the drop, these products, as always, will get sold out in minutes. Speaking of the drop...

# The Iconic Drop.

In a business world, the drop is an excellent technique if a seller already has a growing audience or interest in a product. The product is in limited supply which means they’re exclusive, like Kylie’s lip kits, and they’re only released in limited quantities, meaning they’re more desirable, exciting, and have a better buzz around them.

Kylie builds demand on her website by highlighting that a product is “_back in stock_” or that it’s “_limited edition_” only and it insinuates that this item is in high demand and may not be available for long. There’s also a clock on the main page counting down to a new product release, which keeps her customers glued to screens with their credit cards in hand, hoping to make their purchase in time. When the lip kits are restocked or launched on her website they sell out within minutes. While other celebrities don’t get that kind of sales on their product, Kylie makes good use of the drop to get this boost.

The whole Kylie Cosmetics experience away from the virtual world is a completely different setting. Kylie always teases the launch of a new store on her social handles a few weeks before to get her audience ready for a major shopping haul. Before the launch of Kylie Jenner’s first pop-up store, people camped in the parking lot overnight to be first in line in the morning.

Once the doors opened, the customers had as long as 15 minutes to get their hands on their favorite products, and couldn’t see any prices until they were at the register, where they could buy only up to _three versions of a single item_. Those who were quick enough to make it to the cash register on time left beaming, with many showcasing their spoils on social media. Imagine thousands of people going out of their way to come to your store and buy your products, just to look like you. It’s absolutely crazy, but she did it.

## Kylie Jenner built a $900 million fortune in less than three years

You might not agree with me on that point. If so, you’re not alone. A little over three years ago, Forbes made the big announcement. Kylie Jenner became the world’s youngest _self-made_ billionaire. She did it with no more than a Shopify store, a seven-person team, and super solid content marketing. She grew her cosmetics brand into a $900M business in three years _without any paid traffic_.

They gave Kylie Jenner the crown and the decision was met with some controversy. Could she really be called “self-made?” Critics said most of her success came from the privilege of her family and connections. While I definitely agree that a good amount of her brand's visibility is brought in through her celebrity status, growing a business from the ground up is not easy and I think she deserves some credit. Constantly being in the public eye and putting her life out there for everyone to see does get her a lot of hate on the internet but hey, the Kardashian-Jenner clan are pretty used to it by now.

# **Celeb Collab**

Who says celebrity marketing isn’t for celebrity-run brands? Kylie knew that her audience was likely to use Instagram to find brands, Youtube for product recommendations, and Snapchat to share their experiences. So she strategically uses beauty influencers to gain the respect and recognition of the online beauty community. Popular YouTube beauty influencers such as MakeupShayla, Nicol Concilio, and James Charles all have endorsed Kylie’s products by doing some super cool makeup looks on Kylie herself.

She even partners up with her sisters and their brands to sort of milk that Kardashian-Jenner family status, and it's a win-win for everyone. What’s even cooler? After the birth of her daughter, she launched Kylie Baby, a cruelty-free baby product line. From launching lip kits as a product of her insecurity to launching baby products so her daughter can get the best, she’s come a long way.

## She’s only 24 and _she’s absolutely crushing it._

She built the right audience, made a great product, and marketed it the right way. She completely killed it. This proves she’s more than a pretty face, she’s:

On a final note, Kylie Jenner is the face of the brand — not the lipsticks, not the cosmetics. Her brand is successful because it is personal. Purchasing her products gives her fans the experience of what it's like to be Kylie Jenner. So when she promotes her products on her social handles, it feels like a recommendation from a friend rather than from a salesperson.

So as Kris Jenner would say,
