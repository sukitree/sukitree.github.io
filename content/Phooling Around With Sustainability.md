Flowers play a huge role in the sacred practices of Hindu culture. But now that I think about it, I never thought of what happens to them after their use. Are they being disposed of properly? Am I somehow harming the environment by using them constantly? I don’t think this crosses anyone’s mind. So when I came across Phool, I couldn’t help but dive deeper into what they’re doing and how they’re making such a great impact. _Allow me to explain :)_

# Discovering a Phoolish Waste Management System

Kanpur is a city in Uttar Pradesh known for its beautiful temples. During the Indian festival of Makara Sankranti, Ankit Agarwal and his friend sat by the Ghats of the River Ganges, observing the large heaps of temple flowers forming vast stretches in the sacred waters. There wasn’t a proper waste management system that disposed of temple waste properly and they couldn't help but think about the harmful effects caused by these decaying flowers on the water bodies and the aquatic life.

After some exhaustive research, Ankit discovered that more than 8.4 tonnes of flowers grown with insecticides and pesticides were being dumped into the Ganges from temples in Uttar Pradesh every day. These flowers get mixed up with the water and form toxic compounds, suppressing the oxygen level and end up posing a threat to marine life. So they embarked on their mission to repurpose the waste coming from places of worship, and that was how Phool was born.

# Flowercycling and Sustainability

Currently, Phool has managed to upcycle more than 2753 metric tonnes of temple flowers using organic vermicompost methods. They specifically employ _flowercycling_ — a technology that is used to recycle flower waste. In an attempt to preserve the Ganges, Phool uses these flowers to create fragrances, incense sticks, and cones that are 100% organic, charcoal free, and sustainable, in turn offsetting 11 tonnes of pesticides along the process.

Phool has also expanded into the field of bio-packaging by coming up with a sustainable and cheaper alternative to Thermocol called Florafoam. Florafoam is 100% biodegradable, durable, mouldable, and high performing, and can be buried in your garden post use. So basically, everything about this product, inside and out, is so well thought out to ensure that there’s minimal harm to the environment. Pretty cool if you ask me.

# Women at the core

Phool doesn't only stand out as a sustainable brand but it's also appreciated as a huge supporter of women. All the flowercyclers at Phool are women from marginalized communities in various parts of India like Kanpur, Tirupati, Mathura, and Varanasi. Most of these women were previously considered ‘untouchables’ in their communities due to their profession (manual scavenging).

By employing women from this section of society, not only is Phool providing them with financial security, allowing them to send their children to schools, and helping them break out from the vicious cycle of unemployment that plagues manual scavengers, but it is also giving them a platform to live dignified lives with respect and confidence. We love seeing women being uplifted, and Phool did so in such a great way, take a look :)

# Phoolproof Branding and Design

Phool’s branding caught my eye instantly. The designs are earthly, folk-art-inspired, and don’t have any marketing clutter.

The silhouette of the woman on the cover is a reflection of the woman whose hard work made the product you see in your hands. And so, the brand valorizes the creators on its packaging. The clean, blue water visual literally reminds the user that they’re contributing to cleaning up the holy Ganga by purchasing this product.

The concept also reflects the popular idea of purity in prayer: in addition to bathing beforehand, wearing clean clothes, and remaining barefoot, it gives the customer a sense of comfort in knowing that their choice of dhoop/agarbatti is keeping the Ganga clean. The thought behind it is genius and this designer definitely deserves a raise.

# Marketing Lessons for Everyone

Phool is a great case study when you’re looking into marketing products in the sustainability space. Sustainability today is becoming a trend where followers are willing to change their way of life just to align with the ideology. So to this cohort, you don’t really have to push the idea of sustainability too much.

Whereas to appeal to a broader audience of buyers, sustainability will need to be built with additional layers of meaning. It’s not about offering additional benefits that justify price premiums as per conventional marketing thinking. It’s about added layers of meaning that give every user a feel-good factor, not just the eco-conscious ones. Phool shows us how that’s done in an elegant and classy way.

# Conclusions

Phool’s success is a hard-earned one. When Phool started, the very idea of recycling floral waste seemed preposterous to temple patrons. This is a venture that’s bounded by religious traditions and it took a lot of time and effort for the team to convey their motive.

This brand is so attractive as it puts recycling at the heart of its offering. Not just recycling, but recycling temple flowers into incense products _and_ uplifting its women workers in the process. Phool’s ambition is to expand to the whole of India and create 2,000 jobs by the end of 2022 and I can’t wait to see them grow.

To conclude, I just want to say that it’s great to see homegrown brands solving problems we never paid attention to, and to see them do it in such a classy way is so rare, but [Phool](https://phool.co/) truly nailed it.

Also, I apologize for all the Phool puns but that’s what you signed up for so I guess you just have to deal with it ❤
