#### How a brand that sells only one product changed the world’s perception of marketing.

#### If you think RedBull sells a mere energy drink, you’re wrong. They sell the sneaking out of your hostel past curfew type of adrenaline.

Instead of long ads with brand promises, they focus on things their audience can relate to. After all, consumers want authenticity. You’d be surprised to hear that they’re not only successful now with their high-budget events, but they also made a mark during their low-budget early days.

Back when the RedBull energy drink first came out, they scouted for their target audience (18 to 35-year-old males) at college parties, libraries, coffee shops, bars, and other key hangout spots and just placed the product right into their customer's hands. They even placed empty cans in crowded public areas to create the impression that the brand was popular. Extremely clever.

Their first guerilla marketing move with “The Red Bull Girls” was iconic. Red Bull brought together a group of girls to hand out free drinks to college students with the cliche expectation that college boys, their target audience at the time, are going to take the drink without a second thought. And guess what, this worked so well for the company and rapidly drove up sales. These girls were paid quite well to distribute the drink and take part in the brand's events, so it was a win-win for both parties.

#### Consumers love brands that are built around a story, and the Red Bull team figured this out more than three decades ago.

Red Bull understands that its customers are young and active and they understand that customers in this age range are extremely savvy when it comes to advertising. So instead of trying to market its product to these customers (which would be a turnoff to them), Red Bull focuses its content on the activities they love. Here’s how they do it:

##### They take their tagline a little too seriously.

“Red Bull gives you wings” focuses on the idea that their product gives people the “wings” or energy they need to do whatever they want when they want. Now if you think this only pertains to helping you pull an all-nighter to study for a test, you’re wrong. That’s probably level zero of the intensity of Red Bull stunts. Want to jump from 128,000 ft above the earth from a small ship and helium balloon? You know what to drink.

##### Experiences tell a better story than cliche advertisements.

Want to jump from 128,000 ft above the earth from a small ship and helium balloon? You know what to drink.

From extreme cliff diving to music and film festivals, RedBull’s done it all. If you look closely, the product (the Red Bull energy drink) is barely shown. Instead, the majority of the commercial (can we even call it that?) focuses on the extreme activities their athletes are engaged in.

##### Red Bull is that once friend in a group project who sits back and does the bare minimum, but still gets fair credit at the end.

RedBull has a way of making its audience generate a good amount of content for them. From [Red Bull Backyards](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnuf8iyXggLHwf4jUr5peixk-tFx8kW80)- a series where consumers pull off some super cool stunts in their very own space, to Wings with a View, a campaign where consumers posted breathtaking pictures with the energy drink, Red Bull basically makes its consumers do 80% of the work. Which I think is brilliant.

##### Turning fans into consumers.

Let’s take Formula 1 as an example. Red Bull doesn’t just pour its money into Formula 1 to have its logo on a wide range of marketing material, they own a team altogether. When you look back at Max Verstappen winning the world championship last year, you remember that he achieved this with the Red Bull team. What we don’t realize is the brand taking the center stage and making history. Likewise, Red Bull also sponsors various sports teams and athletes, and fans who support the team or players, eventually become supportive of the brand.

##### Why the wings never seem to tire out

- Their ability is to sell their brand but not push their product keeps the customers hooked.
  
- Their content focuses solely on the enjoyment of the reader, not selling Red Bull. In turn, their audience begins to associate their product with content that they love to consume.
  
- While they’re active on an array of channels and use tons of different tactics, everything revolves around one concept: creating content and experiences people would be interested in _even if they don’t care about energy drink brands._
  
  Overall I’d say Red Bull is one of the best marketing companies out there. Yup, you read that right. Marketing company. And I can’t wait to see what those wings have in store for the future.
