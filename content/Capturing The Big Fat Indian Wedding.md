This week, I want to talk about a brand that I absolutely adore. No out-of-the-box growth moves, crazy campaigns or anything of that sort. Just a brand that grew to what it is today because of pure passion and talent. A brand that I’ve been reading about since I was 14 years old.

**Stories by Joseph Radhik.** To tell you about this brand, I need to tell you about its founder, who’s the literal heart and soul of this story.

Joseph Radhik is arguably India’s most celebrated wedding photographer, known for his breathtaking imagery and mastery of the craft. His pictures aren’t anything you’ll see in a regular wedding album; they’re grand, perfectly timed, beautiful, and always real — they look more like classic cinema posters.

# Sunsets, flowers, and insects.

Born in coastal Andhra and growing up in Hyderabad, Joseph’s love for photography started young. When he was a kid, his aunt got him a box full of National Geographic magazines and he instantly fell in love with the pictures he came across. He was so in awe of what he saw in those pages that he took cutouts and placed them in a scrap box to start a collection.

His journey with making images started in 2001 when he was an engineering student who took a digital camera to class all the time. Right after engineering, he went on to IIM Indore to pursue an MBA _(sounds about right)_. At the moment he was a rookie in the photography space and like every other rookie with a camera, he took pictures of sunsets, flowers, and insects :)

# Mid 20’s existential crisis

Right after graduation, he relocated to Banaras for a job, but his love for photography remained constant. After work, he’d go to the nearest railway station and take pictures, or on Sundays, he’d travel to nearby villages to get a couple of shots.

After a conversation with his boss, the typical mid-20-s “what am I doing with my life” existential crisis crept in where he realized that he was just 25. He has so much time to make mistakes. So much time to “live his life”. He realized that there are career paths beyond what you see in a business school and so many ways to build a career. So he left his corporate job, emailed Elephant Design, India's oldest design home, learned new things at work, and finally found time to indulge in photography.

# Identifying an untapped market

In 2009, Joseph’s sister was set to get married. Sibling duties put Jospeph on the task to scout for good photographers to capture his sister's wedding. So naturally, he googled the keywords — “Wedding Photographer India”. Out of the few results that showed up, all of them turned out to be busy. I mean, it’s India. Weddings take place more consistently than DJ nights on Saturdays.

So this time he googled — “Wedding Photographer”, and that was it. He never ended up finding a photographer for his sister's wedding but he scrolled through wedding pictures the entire day. After 10 years of shooting sunsets, flowers, and insects, he found something that he genuinely admired and realized that this is what he wanted to do. **Wedding Photography.**

# First Impressions

On 2nd Jan 2010, Joseph shot his first-ever wedding for a fee of 7000 INR. On 15th Jan, Kodak opened up submissions for Wedding Photographer of the Year. Even though he had only one gig up his sleeve, he submitted the pictures anyways. And what’s better? He was nominated in 5/6 categories. A rookie wedding photographer who had shot only one wedding till now. That’s pure talent right there.

# Turning Points

Joseph quit his job and posted on Facebook that he’s now a full-time wedding photographer. By then. someone had blogged about his Kodak nominations and it reached CNN. They called him for an interview on prime time television and did a piece on Joseph where they filmed him shooting a wedding. He was quickly building his brand and started doing professional photography talks while showcasing his work.

During a talk, one of the audience members of the front row came up to him and said, “You have to shoot my friends’ wedding, his name’s Bunny.” As someone who wasn’t too aware of the Telugu movie industry, he just thought it was a funny name. Bunny, aka Allu Arjun, is one of the biggest stars of Telugu cinema. And in March 2011, shooting his wedding was a huge turning point in Joseph’s career. He made it to local newspapers and built a foundation for wedding photography in India. It was only upward from there.

# The story of Stories

In 2012, he called his brother Joshua to join him, and together, they launched Stories. Stories came about with the goal to ensure that wedding photography lives beyond them. And as of the company’s success, Joesph and his team at Stories started to shoot weddings all around the world. From weddings in Rome to Mauritius, they left a mark everywhere.

What makes Stories so special is that they’re not just another Instagram page sticking to current trends. They capture emotion, color, love, and joy from the middle of the celebration. The pictures they take look like pictures from a friend's perspective, not a photography agency you hired.

Today, Stories is a large team of talented photographers and cinematographers spread across India capturing moments of joy and love in weddings around the world. They've become an international brand of wedding photography that has been recognized several times by media around the world: Vogue UK, Grazia, Elle, Asian Photography Journal, Brides UK for example.

The Team, at Stories by Joesph Radhik

## The reason I love this brand.

I know this isn’t like any other blog I’ve written before. But hey, I love weddings. And the team at Stories captures weddings in some level of raw serendipity.

The photographs have a beautiful, vibrant color palette, which Joseph says, is “a consequence of the fact that we’re Indian wedding photographers. We’re not the white gown, black tuxedo types; we’re the sherwani, lehenga, Kanjeevaram saree type. We are orange, red, yellow, blue; we’re anything but black and white”

It’s not just the pictures I admire, I love how the team members themselves are so independently talented. It’s not just about Joseph and his brother. Many team members stand on their own now, with clients specifically asking for them. Noel David, Allen Joseph, Shivali Chopra, and Mohamed Jameer are my personal favorites. This is also a brand that’s keen on getting more photographers on the Stories level by bringing in young talent and teaching the next generation the ropes of wedding photography. They’re so evidently invested in the future of wedding photography and it’s amazing to watch it all happen in front of you.

[Stories](https://stories.josephradhik.com/home) grew to capture the weddings of some big names in the world. From Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s wedding to Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, _(and hopefully my wedding one day haha jokes)_ Stories have done it all.

So, to conclude, I’m going to end this blog with some of my all-time favorites, enjoy :)
