#### How the Amul Girl won the moment marketing game.

Right off the bat, what makes Amul so special is that ever since its foundation, it has constantly managed to stay relevant in the minds of the customers of different generations.

How did they do that? It’s not only about the low-cost pricing strategy that helped them become a household staple. it’s the fact that they have products that cater to _every_ generation of customers. From Amul Kool and Amul Chocolates and Icecreams for kids to Amul Shakti and Amul Lite butter for the adults, they’ve got everything. And what’s better? They’re absolute geniuses when it comes to spreading the word about their products. Over the years, Amul’s witty marketing has become more popular than its products.

## Amul never misses out to grab any opportunity that comes its way to integrate it with its brand.

You see what I’m talking about? The Amul team realized that talking about just butter wouldn’t sustain them for long. So they hit on this idea of social commentary. At a certain point, it went from commenting on one topic a month, or every two months, to what they do now — which is literally bring a topic to light almost every day

Through their ads, they have frequently raised their voice against issues, which are generally not considered important in FMCG product advertising. The ads reflect the state of mind of the nation at that moment and that way, they build a connection to their audience.

# The Amul Girl does not age.

#### Fun fact: The Amul Girl was created as a response to Amul’s rival brand’s mascot, Polson’s butter-girl all the way back in 1967.

When the first Amul hoarding was put out in Mumbai, she was the talk of the town. People used to wait eagerly for Fridays to come around just to see what Amul came up with that week. What really stood out for people back then was Amul took the personality of a bold, unapologetic journalist, which was pretty rare.

These ads were not just a source of amusement but also made people aware of what was happening around them. So as much as they served as a good laugh to adults at social gatherings, parents used to use them to keep their children up to date with current affairs. Remarkably, the style and approach of the campaign hasn’t changed too much at all in the course of time.

The Amul Girl has been around for generations. To top it all off, she even holds a world record for the longest-run ad campaign ever. Cool, right? Well, she’s been making the rounds for over five decades, what do you expect?

# Content over platform.

Back in the Amul Girl’s early days, she made her rounds on local newspapers and television ads. You’d think she’d stop there and move on to retirement at some point but she managed to create a buzz with the current generation by taking over the digital space as well.

They started referencing current events, just as so many brands do on Twitter today. Amul was a kind of proto-meme brand, and the way they leverage Twitter today, where they now post all of their ads, in addition to putting them on billboards, has been a natural extension of a half-century-long engagement strategy.

The idea behind the content remained the same, and the only change was the platform. Overall, the shift from offline to online advertising wasn’t hard on Amul. They were already creating content for banners and newspapers previously and now they just follow the same style for their creatives on Facebook & Instagram as well.

# The Taste of India.

‘Amul Doodh Peetha Hai India,’’ Har Ghar Amul Ghar,’’ Pehla Pyaar Amul Pyaar”, are jingles I’m sure you’ve heard. But “The Taste of India” truly stands out. The idea behind the tagline was to banish the notion that bread and butter are a staple of only the British breakfast. So Amul took a more family-friendly and patriotic approach which evoked empathy towards the brand.

# The Amul Girl is here to stay.

With the attention span of the target audience deteriorating day by day, quick and short but relevant content acts as a great engagement magnet for brands. Being conscious with choices of content and quickly delivering it to the audience can be a handful but Amul nailed it.

The Amul girl clearly hasn’t become boring and has managed to stay at the top of her game after all these years. It’s not just her, Amul’s #SimpleHomeMadeRecipes played a significant role in everyone’s lockdown experience. They even took a step ahead and launched the Amul App to help their customers locate Amul products near them. They always go the extra mile to connect with their customers, whether it's through engaging content or turning Twitter into a personal customer care space. Who doesn’t like the attention? Clearly, they’ve made a mark that’s going to stay for a long, long time.
